After the class lecture on the markovify command, I decided to approach my novel using this python package.  The idea behind my
novel was to take two move scripts and combine them to make an entirely new story.  I used the scripts from <i>Detective Pikachu</i> and
<i>National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation</i> because they both have characters who say hilarious lines in their films.  After reading through
my final product, I noticed three different text arrangements.  Some parts of the novel had lines that was a combination of both scripts,
other parts had a pattern of lines from one movie after the other, and there were mixtures of altered punctuation or capitalization in
the wrong places.  Most of my novel is readable, and I can put sentences together despite the alterations.  After reading through it, I did
laugh at some parts of it because of how bizarre some of lines were generated.
